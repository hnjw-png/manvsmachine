# Color Scheme

I firstly tried some different color combinations. In the end I decided the most visually pleasing and practical was the colors blue, white and black. The Website header and the game title are in blue, as well as the footer. While the player score and computer score titles are black, this is to differiniate from the title, this I tried and saw it looked to close, so black is the better option. The buttons are with a white background and a blue text, with a black outline, they corilate with the rest of the site, but still stand out. The background is white, this words nicely with the blue.

* normal shade of white
* basic shade of black

# Typography

I choose the font 'Lobster' this font has a nice clear look, which is a little bit like clear fancy handwriting, this stands out well and fits the style of the game.

# Wireframes

I this time drawn all my designs by hand, the next time I utilise wireframes. I did although use a website called wix to design my site, so i could 

## Features

# Responsiveness:

This website fits to size on all types of devices. From laptop to mobile phone. I editted the media queries for the ipad size devices and smaller devices, as the rest of the devices were already responsive. The mobile phone game is little bit bigger, but the intention is to play the game with your phone titled horizontially. In the game on the computer, laptop or large iPad you play the game horizontially aand smalled devices such as mobiles you play vertically.

# Features:

## Game Buttons:

There are three game buttons, that upon being pressed give a score and result. There are clearly lined up at the top center of the page.
Above you can see, the name of the game is very clear, as clearly written above the buttons, is 'are you ready to play rock, paper, scissors?'

## Main Game page:

The main page is a simply page with a clear purpose, to play rock paper scissors. You can see clearly where to click the buttons, and where your score should appear. The only option currently is to play computer againist human, but not yet human to human.

## The RPS images:

The start image for both player and user is a png of rock, paper and scissors image, this image source changes to rock, paper or a scissors jpg, depending on the desicion made.

## The Score counters:

The score counter is alongside the 'man' and 'computer' headings, there your score will update with the correct score up to 3. The first who gets 2 points win, as its a best of three game. Thereafter the winner will be declared, with the words in the title. 'Winner or Loser'.

# Footer:

The footer is a simple statement of 'do you like the game, follow us on facebook!', and next to it, is a button that links you to facebook. This is a good way in future to measure how success ful the game is.

# JSHINT

There were some errors in the jshint, these were about how the incrementScore variable, drawscore function.I need to research more into. Other than this there were no more errors.


# Bug fixes

* Does game work on all devices: Yes! I added a media query to ipad sized devices.

* Are instructions clear to the user: Yes! I tested this myself and also tested it with a friend.

* Is the games purpose obvious? Yes! It is very obvious where to click and who wins is clearly appears on the screen upon each round. The color scheme and font sizing work well on all devices.

* Does the computer play the game automatically after a player choice? Yes! The players clicks a option and the computer automatically picks one at random.

* Does the image change, when the appripriate button is clicked? Yes! Yes if you click rock, the rock image appears, and the same goes for paper and scissors.

*THIS FUNCTION NO LONGER IS REQUIRED, FOR FUNCTIONALITY OF GAME. Does the score appear on the manscore and computer score sections? No! ... It should be appearing when, the player or the computer, win or lose. I have been troubleshooting this for some days, as I see that the function isn't being translated to the game. I have tried writing various codes to call the function. So I am still working on this, as of now I see the draw function was on its own loop. I believe a gameover function and rounds played function could have been a good addition to the game code. In future I plan to fix these bugs and increment the score according to the rock, paper, scissors game parimeters. Then I would like the winner to be drawn out of three rounds, and pop-up text stating the winner, loser or a tie. Then the game to restart. - This was never acheived and instead resolved with a string stating who

*tHIS FUNCTION IS NO LONGER REQUIRED FOR FUNCTIONALITY OF GAME: Does the game calculate rounds? No, it does not function creating rounds, I have tried several different code combinations, but I need to experience javascript to fix these bugs. I am working on calling variables, and not making the mistake of creating a endless loop.

* BUG FIXED: The game functions visually, but not practically, the game clearly interacts well with the user as when a button is clicked, the computer automatically makes its choice. But thereafter there is no functionality on the score counter. In the future, I will go back, and fix the game so the user experience is 100%, that the player knows how many points he/she has and they can then know who is the winner. Then the full experience of the game will be executed.

* In the final edit I could not succeed in creating a score board so instead created a much more interaction and fun mesaage that appears each round, showing which one won, the computer or the human. This creates a meaning to the game in the future, I would work again on adding a score board. This functions perfectly with the logic of the game of rock, paper, scissors.
